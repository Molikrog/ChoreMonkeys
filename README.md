#  ChoreMonkeys 

##  Getting Started

During my ChoreMonkey project, I developed a web application that connects users needing help with everyday chores to those seeking small paid jobs. Working independently, I built core features like user registration, job posting, and a location-based job view. The platform promotes community collaboration by offering quick access to tasks like cleaning, lifting, and pet sitting.
